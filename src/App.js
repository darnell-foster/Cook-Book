  * State is like a componentâ€™s memory. 
  * State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time
  * It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. 
  * A parent component will often keep some information in state (so that it can change it), and pass it down to child components as their props.
  * Props are like arguments you pass
  * They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance.
  * 
  * Search Bar uses State becasue it needs to display search text
